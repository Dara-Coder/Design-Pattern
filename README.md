### What is design pattern?

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished design that can be directly transformed into code, but rather a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. They help prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improve code readability for developers familiar with the patterns.

Design patterns are classified into three main categories:
> 1. Creational patterns: Provide ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic, such as Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, and Singleton.
> 2. Structural patterns: Concern class and object composition, using inheritance to compose interfaces or objects to obtain new functionality, such as Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.
> 3. Behavioral patterns: Specifically concerned with communication between objects, such as Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which it is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution. Key elements include the pattern name, intent, motivation, applicability, structure, participants, collaborations, consequences, implementation, sample code, known uses, and related patterns.

Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers to communicate, and allow for improvement over time to make them more robust than ad-hoc designs. However, they have been criticized by some as targeting the wrong problem, as the need for patterns can result from using languages or techniques with insufficient abstraction ability
